## The Power of Optimization

Optimization is the key to efficient logistics. With JOpt, you can let a human dispatcher or the included ObjectiveTuner adjust optimization criteria to achieve the best fit for your dispatching goals and business cases. Let JOpt do the heavy lifting and create efficient solutions tailored to your needs.
 
## Automation at its Best
Is your product lacking an automated optimization engine? JOpt is the perfect solution. It not only saves money, time, and workforce, but also allows you to focus on your core business. 

Designed as an integrable module for logistics planning applications and standard ERP systems, JOpt can assist with a wide range of dispatching tasks:

- Determining arrival times at tour stops
- Ensuring that fixed appointments are met
- Keeping track of all drivers' and resources' working times
- Allocating a large number of tasks to mobile resources or large-scale vehicle fleets

With JOpt, you can efficiently plan and optimize tours for all your trucks and resources, ensuring minimized time and travel distances while adhering to necessary constraints. Leverage the power of JOpt.TourOptimizer to streamline your planning process. This robust engine is designed to autonomously generate optimal routes for each of your trucks and resources, meticulously taking into account all shipments and tasks for the day. While its primary goal is to minimize time and travel distances, JOpt.TourOptimizer goes a step further to ensure that all your unique constraints are met, striking a fine balance between efficiency and customization.

These constraints can include a range of factors, such as adherence to working hours and travel-time regulations, recognizing the specific skills of drivers, compliance with transportation rules, and respecting the personal preferences of both resources and customers. JOpt.TourOptimizer also takes into account pre-negotiated and confirmed appointment times and other hard constraints. Its goal is to provide a comprehensive solution that balances operational efficiency with the nuanced needs of your business.

## Seamless Integration
The integration of JOpt components into your existing solutions is straightforward. Whether you're using Docker with the renowned Swagger REST-API or integrating it as a native Java dependency via Maven or direct Jar download, JOpt is compatible with your setup. It supports multiple programming languages, including C#, Java, JS, Scala, Python, and many more.
